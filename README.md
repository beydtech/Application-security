QUESTION:Download OWSAP ZAP and perform a security scan on a website you have access to. 
Explain the steps you followed to set up and configure ZAP for the scan. Provide a 
detailed report highlighting any vulnerabilities or security issues identified during the 
scan. 

ANSWER;
 OWASP ZAP Scan Summary Report
Target: OWASP Juice Shop (Localhost)
OS Used: Kali Linux
Tool: OWASP ZAP,run via Docker
Scan Type: Automated Scan
Launched Juice Shop locally (usually runs on http://localhost:3000).
Entered the target URL in ZAP: http://localhost:3000
Date: 29-09-2025

Starting the Attack
   -Selected the target site in ZAP‚Äôs ‚ÄúSites‚Äù tab.
   - Right-clicked the target ‚Üí "Attack" ‚Üí "Active Scan".
   - Chose default scan settings and launched the scan.
     
Monitoring the Scan
   - Watched alerts populate in real-time.
   - Waited for the scan to complete (note: system crashed once during the scan, had to resume)
     
Exporting the Report
   - After completion, exported the full scan report as an HTML/Markdown file (zap_scan_report.html).
   - Also documented a summary of key vulnerabilities for reporting.

üìäSummary findings

The scan detected 14 types of vulnerabilities
NOTE: High Risk ‚Äì needs urgent fixing
      Medium Risk ‚Äì should be addressed soon
      Low Risk ‚Äì not critical, but worth fixing
      Informational ‚Äì things to be aware of, but not dangerous
      
1. SQL Injection - SQLite (High):  
   The app is vulnerable to SQL Injection, allowing attackers to manipulate queries, access sensitive data, or even corrupt the database.

2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set (Medium):  
   Without a CSP header, the site is more vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.

3. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (Medium):  
   The app allows resources to be shared with untrusted or wildcard domains, increasing the risk of data leakage.

4. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header (Medium):  
   Absence of X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors allows clickjacking attacks via embedded iframes.

5. Session ID in URL Rewrite (Medium):  
   Session identifiers are included in URLs, which can be logged, shared, or leaked ‚Äî leading to session hijacking risks.

6. Vulnerable JavaScript Library (Medium):  
   A JS library used in the site is known to have public vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

7. Cross-Domain JavaScript Inclusion (Low):  
   Including JS files from external domains increases the chance of executing malicious scripts if the third-party source is compromised.

8. Private IP Disclosure (Low):Internal IPs were found in responses. This can help attackers map internal infrastructure.

9. Timestamp Disclosure - Unix (Low):  
   The app leaks Unix timestamps, which can help attackers understand app behavior or timing of events.

10. Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header (Low): 
    Without this header, browsers may incorrectly interpret MIME types, leading to content sniffing attacks.

11. Suspicious Comments (Informational):  
    HTML or JS files contain developer comments that may reveal sensitive or debugging information.

12. Modern Web Application (Informational):  
    ZAP identifies the app as using modern web features; not a vulnerability, but a scan artifact.

13. Retrieved from Cache (Informational):  
    Some resources are cached by browsers, which could allow attackers to serve stale or vulnerable content in certain scenarios.

14. User Agent Fuzzer (Informational):  
    ZAP‚Äôs user-agent fuzzer triggered multiple responses, suggesting the app responds differently to various user-agent strings.

‚úÖ Recommendations

- Use parameterized queries to eliminate SQL Injection.
- Apply security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
